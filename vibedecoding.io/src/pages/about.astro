      <h2>What is Vibe Decoding?</h2>
      <p>
        Vibe Decoding is both a concept and a project. It's the practice of turning life's ambient
        signals—bookmarks, notes, articles, conversations, ideas—into timely, contextual action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of letting information disappear into scattered apps and forgotten folders, Vibe Decoding
        captures everything as events in a unified life stream. AI agents enrich these events,
        building context and connections. The result: the right information surfaces at the right moment.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Build This?</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been frustrated by the gap between capturing information and using it. We have
        incredible tools for saving things—but terrible tools for resurfacing them when they matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is my attempt to bridge that gap. It combines event streaming (Kafka), AI agents
        (Claude), and real-time processing (Flink) into a personal knowledge system that actually works.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ian Bull, a software engineer who's spent years thinking about information systems,
        developer tools, and the intersection of AI with personal productivity.
